# Running Your Game

## 1. Install Node.js  
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  

## 2. Open the Terminal  
In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal:  

- You can do this by going to the menu and selecting **Terminal > New Terminal** or by using the shortcut `` Ctrl + ` ``.  

## 3. Navigate to the Project Directory  
Ensure you are in the root directory of your cloned repository. You can use the `cd` command to navigate:  

```bash  
cd path/to/your/cloned/repository
```

## 4. Install Dependencies
If the project has a `package.json` file, you need to install the required dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

## 5. Check for Express
The error message indicates that the express module is not found. If it's listed in `package.json`, it should have been installed with `npm install`. If not, you can install it manually:

```bash
npm install express
```

## 6. Start the Server
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the server. If the entry point is `server.js`, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

If there is a specific script defined in `package.json` (like `start`), you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

## 7. Access the Game
After starting the server, open your web browser and navigate to the address where the server is running, typically `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`, depending on your server configuration.

## 8. Debugging
If you encounter any further errors, check the terminal output for messages and ensure all required modules are installed. You can also check the `package.json` file for any scripts or additional setup instructions.

## Summary
By following these steps, you should be able to run the game locally from Visual Studio Code. If you encounter any specific issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
